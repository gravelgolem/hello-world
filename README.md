Stuff for the world at large

gravelgolem is my game maker pseudonym, and my goal is to help along godot to being the basis for a Bethesda-CreationKit rivalling open source RPG modding/making experience.
Also, making truly great 2d games that draw on the magic of the games of my youth with all the lessons I've learned since is something I'd like to do.
